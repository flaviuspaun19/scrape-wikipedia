# Wikipedia Data and Content Analyzer
A comprehensive Python script for web scraping, data analysis, and visualization.

## Overview
This project is a powerful tool designed to interact with and analyze data from Wikipedia. It performs a two-part process:

**Data Analysis**: It automatically scrapes tabular data on global population from a specific Wikipedia page, cleans it, calculates key statistics, and generates a professional-looking bar chart of the top 10 most populous countries.

**Web Scraping**: It provides a dynamic utility to analyze any Wikipedia URL by summarizing the content within each section, counting paragraphs, words, hyperlinks, and pictures.

This tool is a great demonstration of a full-stack data pipeline, from data acquisition to insightful visualization.

## Features
**Web Scraping**: Leverages `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse structured and unstructured content from web pages.

**Data Cleaning**: Utilizes pandas to efficiently clean and transform raw tabular data, handling common issues like text-based footnotes and commas.

**Data Analysis**: Performs quantitative analysis to derive meaningful insights, such as calculating the average population and identifying top-tier data points.

**Data Visualization**: Creates a clear, aesthetically pleasing bar chart with matplotlib to visually represent the data.

**Modular Design**: Structured with distinct functions for each core task (scraping, cleaning, plotting), ensuring the code is maintainable and easy to extend.

**Robust Error Handling**: Incorporates try...except blocks to gracefully handle network issues and data-related errors.

## Requirements
To get started, you need the required Python libraries. You can install them using the requirements.txt file provided.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Ensure all dependencies are installed.

4. Run the script from your terminal:

`python population_analyzer.py`


The script will automatically start by generating the population chart. Afterward, it will enter an interactive mode, prompting you to enter any Wikipedia URL for content analysis.

## Example Output
Here's an example of the bar chart generated by the script, which is saved in a new charts/ folder in the project directory:
